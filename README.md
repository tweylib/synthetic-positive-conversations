# synthetic-positive-conversations
This dataset contains 150 synthetic conversations generated using the Gemini 2.5 flash model. The dataset was created to address a significant gap in existing mental health corpora: most available datasets focus on problem-oriented dialogues (stress, anxiety, depression) and lack uplifting, strength-based, and positive content.
